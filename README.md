âœ… Complete HTML Version Ready!
I've successfully converted the React TSX component to a standalone HTML file with the exact same functionality. Here's what you get:
ðŸŽ¯ Features Included (Same as React Version)
âœ… Realistic tunnel traffic simulation with 3 lanes
âœ… Dynamic vehicle spawning (cars, trucks, emergency vehicles)
âœ… AI-powered incident detection (slow/stopped vehicles, hot spots)
âœ… 4 camera zones with switchable views
âœ… Live environmental monitoring (air quality, temperature, visibility)
âœ… Interactive control panel (Start/Pause/Reset)
âœ… AI insights sidebar with timestamped alerts
âœ… Incident acknowledgment system
âœ… Tunnel lighting effects with flickering animation
âœ… Emergency exit markers
âœ… Real-time metrics dashboard
ðŸ’¡ Key Technical Details
Pure Vanilla JavaScript:

No React dependencies
Uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps animation
All state managed in JavaScript variables (no localStorage)
Lucide icons loaded from CDN

Fully Self-Contained:

Single HTML file - no external dependencies except Lucide icons
Works offline (after initial icon CDN load)
No build process needed
Just open in browser and it runs!

Performance Optimized:

Efficient DOM manipulation
Vehicle cleanup when off-screen
Throttled sensor updates
Minimal re-renders

ðŸš€ How to Use

Save the HTML file (e.g., tunnel-simulation.html)
Open in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
Click "Start Simulation" to begin
Switch camera zones to view different tunnel sections
Watch AI detect incidents and display alerts

ðŸ“Š Integration Options
You can integrate this into your VRX app by:

Embedding in iframe:

html<iframe src="tunnel-simulation.html" width="100%" height="800px"></iframe>

As a standalone tab in your app
Copy the JS/CSS into your existing app structure

The HTML version is 100% feature-complete and mirrors the React component exactly! ðŸŽ‰
